# Primes

A method to generate the first n primes and print a multiplication table of each.

## Command-Line Usage

To run the command line:
(tl; dr: `git clone` the project and `rake install` then run `primes 10`)

Clone the directory, then `cd` into it and `rake install` (may need to `bundle install`).
```
$ rake install
```
Then:
```
$ primes 10
```
You should see a multiplication table in your console.
